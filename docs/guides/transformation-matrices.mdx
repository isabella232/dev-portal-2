description: Transformation matrices used by the Vertex platform.

Vertex uses 4x4 column-major afﬁne transformation matrices. The upper-left 3x3 sub-matrix represents a rotation while the last column represents a translation. Note the final row is always assumed to be `[ 0 0 0 1 ]` regardless of values provided. To rotate an object, see [Rotation matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix#In_three_dimensions). To translate an object, see [Translation matrices](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Translation_(geometry)#Matrix_representation>).
