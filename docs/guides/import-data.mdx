Now that you've [rendered your first scene](./render-your-first-scene.mdx), let's use your own 3D data to make things more interesting. We'll use the Vertex command-line interface (CLI). The CLI makes Vertex API calls on your behalf, simplifying typical operations into single commands.

## Installing

Install the CLI with either [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm) or [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/).

<Tabs
  defaultValue="npm"
  values={[
    { label: 'npm', value: 'npm', },
    { label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn', },
  ]
}>
<TabItem value="npm">

```shell
npm install --global @vertexvis/cli
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn">

:::note

On Windows, you may need to add Yarn's `bin` directory to your `PATH` variable; [more details here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/60436135).
:::

```shell
yarn global add @vertexvis/cli
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>

Verify it's working by accessing help.

```shell
# Help for the CLI as a whole
vertex --help

# Help for an individual command
vertex configure --help

# Help for a topic
vertex scenes --help

# Help for a command within a topic
vertex scenes:get --help
```

## Authenticating

The CLI authenticates Vertex API calls on your behalf. To do this, it requires your Vertex client ID and secret.

:::note

:::

```shell
vertex configure
```

Keep your client ID and secret handy; we'll use it in the following guide as well.

:::note

Some customers use a different base API path than the default (https://platform.vertexvis.com). In this case, add the `--basePath` option to all commands, e.g., `vertex configure --basePath [YOUR_BASE_PATH]`.
:::

After you follow the prompts, the command creates `~/.config/@vertexvis/cli/config.json` on macOS/Linux and `%LOCALAPPDATA%\@vertexvis\cli\config.json` on Windows with your credentials. When you run additional commands, the CLI uses these to authenticate API calls.

## Importing data

To import 3D data in one of [Vertex's supported formats](./supported-file-formats.mdx), create a JSON file containing a list of scene items. Multiple CLI commands use this JSON file to build requests for the API.

:::note

If you do not have 3D data handy, download a model from our [3D database](./model-database.mdx) to follow along.

Below is a simple example of a JSON file with the required parameters specified. For a complete list and explanation of each parameter, see the [type definition](https://github.com/Vertexvis/vertex-cli/blob/master/src/create-items/index.d.ts).

```json title="vertex-valve.json"
[
  {
    "indexMetadata": true,
    "source": {
      "fileName": "[YOUR_PATH_TO_3D_DATA_FILE_INCLUDING_FILE_EXTENSION]",
      "suppliedPartId": "vertex-valve",
      "suppliedRevisionId": "1"
    }
  }
]
```

Next, run `create-parts` with the path to this JSON file as an argument. `create-parts` uploads the 3D data, translates it into 3D geometry, and creates parts in Vertex's Parts Library. The what? Vertex's Parts Library is a repository of your team's or organization's parts, each with references to geometry and optional metadata. As we'll see later in this guide, you can use combinations of these parts to build scenes.

```shell
vertex create-parts [YOUR_PATH_TO_JSON_FILE]
```

## Rendering scenes

With the parts now in Vertex's Parts Library, run `create-scene` to create a scene and add the root part as a scene item to that scene.

```shell
vertex create-scene --name [YOUR_SCENE_NAME] [YOUR_PATH_TO_JSON_FILE]
```

This command prints the created scene ID. Use this ID in the `scenes:render` command to render your scene. The `--viewer` flag creates an HTML file using Vertex's Viewer component similar to the one we wrote in the [Render your first scene](./render-your-first-scene.mdx) guide. It then opens this file in your browser so you can interact with it.

```shell
vertex scenes:render --viewer [YOUR_SCENE_ID]
```

Keep your scene ID handy; we'll use it in the following guide as well.

## Wrapping up

Congratulations! You've imported your own 3D data into Vertex and interacted with it using our Viewer component. To recap the concepts learned so far:

- Vertex's command-line interface (CLI) makes Vertex API calls on your behalf, simplifying typical operations into single commands.
- Vertex's Parts Library is a repository of your team's or organization's parts. You can build scenes using any combination of these parts.

We explained a few in this guide, but for a complete list of CLI commands and their options, check out the [`vertex-cli` README](https://github.com/Vertexvis/vertex-cli).
